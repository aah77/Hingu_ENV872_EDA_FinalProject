The title of this project is "Low Birth Weight Prevalence and Socioeconomic Factors in Chicago", by Aman Hingu. For this project, the dataset used was the Chicago Health Indicators dataset which has public health and socioeconomic indicator data for 77 community areas of the greater Chicago Metropolitan Area.

There is a strong amount of previous work done discussing the effects of maternal nutrition, birth order, and substance use on the likelihood of low birth weight. Outside the context of looking at mothers, it has been observed that factors such as one’s geographic location within an urban city can affect their health as it can effect their access to nutrient dense food vendors, and proximity to high quality healthcare. Where someone lives alone can sometimes be an indicator of their socioeconomic status. 

The research question of this project is exploring whether socioeconomic factors such as unemployment, educational attainment, and portion under poverty level can explain the variability in low live birth weight prevalence across the Chicago community areas.
